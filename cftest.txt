Documenting if this cloud formation template sucessfully gives permissions for s3

Process: 

>> Cloud formation sucessfully created stack, time to verify by logging into instances and using the aws cli for s3

>> aws s3 ls: works- shows my current s3 buckets. now lets see if i can make a bucket

>> aws s3 mb s3://bucket_name - this works as well and also now shows up when I list s3 buckets.
